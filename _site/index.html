      <h3>Hi! I am a mechanical engineer at Cornell University.</h3>

<p>I will graduate with a PhD in 2019. I’m looking for interesting new projects to pursue - please contact me with opportunities at <b>rjs492@cornell.edu</b>. I hope the following information gives you a better idea of how I am qualified for a variety of engineering projects.</p>

<h3>Doctoral research projects:</h3>
<p>At Cornell, I was fortunate enough to be awarded a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, which gave me the flexibility to research a variety of interesting topics. Generally, my research has focused on <u>thermal systems</u>. Click on the images below for more information on each of my recent projects.</p>

<h3>Places I've worked:</h3>
<p>I have a variety of professional experiences, both in industry and at universities. <u>I am a talented engineer and an adept research scientist</u>.</p>

<p>I worked with robotics at both Honda and Dow AgroSciences. It’s hard for me to showcase my work from this topic because of IP limitations; however, I’d be happy to discuss the topic. I have experience with Motoman and EPSON 6-axis and 3-axis robots, vision algorithms for control, and process control for manufacturing.</p>

Rapid sampling is important so that I can tell the actuator to reverse direction at precisely the right time: high strain rates are essential for the largest temperature changes in the refrigerator, but overloading the sample is bad for material fatigue.">Sensors<br /><img src="assets/img/Sensors_small.jpg" /></a>
