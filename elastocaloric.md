## Elastocaloric refrigeration

There are many alternatives to vapor-compression refrigeration in use and in research today. A common solid state form of refrigeration is thermoelectric, which many of us have probably come across at some point. Elastocaloric refrigeration is - on the other hand - not very well known, and has only seen implementation in research environments.

In elastocaloric cooling, a shape memory alloy (SMA) is used as the refrigerant. Nitinol (NiTi) is the most common material. SMAs such as NiTi have the ability to be superelastically strained (see below). At a critical stress, NiTi will undergo a crystal structure transformation and will experience a rapid increase in temperature. This heat can then be removed to the environment. Unloading of the SMA will consequently cause the material to experience a rapid temperature drop, which can be used as part of a refrigeration cycle.

These data show the temperature of the cold and hot water outlets. I have achieved much colder temperatures than shown here from, e.g., regeneration. (Right) This is the stress-strain data on the Nitinol wire during loading (upper plateau) and unloading (lower plateau). When loading, the Nitinol heats up and water is used to pump heat away (see left). Now at room temperature but in a strained state, the Nitinol is unloaded and becomes cold. The 'cold' is then pumped away to a cold reservoir or regenerator."><img src="assets/img/elastogif_small.gif"></a>

Elastocaloric refrigeration is an exciting field because <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy2016134" target="blank">high coefficients of performance (COP) have been demonstrated</a>, and because there is no need to use hydrofluorocarbons as refrigerants.

The goal of my research is to show that elastocaloric coolers can achieve cold-side temperatures that are relevant for common refrigeration applications. <u>I've already achieved temperatures 5Â°C lower than ever before demonstrated</u>. To-date, research has focused on showing high temperature spans when the systems are used as heat pumps.

The Nitinol has the amazing ability to be reversibly strained to 4-5%. In this image I removed the fluid pumps, thermocouples, and valves so that the focus would be on the wire. You may be able to make out some tubing that surrounds the wire, and which is used for fluid flow to transfer heat to or from the wire. On the right is a S-beam load cell."><img src="assets/img/elastocaloric400x150.gif" style="width:400px"></a>

I've built this refrigerator from the ground up - all mechanical, electrical, and thermal subsystems. It's a very exciting project to work on! This research will be published in 2019.
