<h3>Doctoral research projects:</h3>
At Cornell, I was fortunate enough to be awarded a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, which gave me the flexibility to research a variety of interesting topics. Generally, my research has focused on <u>thermal systems</u>. Click on the images below for more information on each of my recent projects.

<h3>Places I've worked:</h3>
I have a variety of professional experiences, both in industry and at universities. <u>I am a talented engineer and an adept research scientist</u>.

I worked with robotics at both Honda and Dow AgroSciences. It's hard for me to showcase my work from this topic because of IP limitations; however, I'd be happy to discuss the topic. I have experience with Motoman and EPSON 6-axis robots, vision algorithms for control, and process control for manufacturing.

I designed all of the components pictured here (minus the standard parts). I also fabricated the first versions of the device in the machine shop. The center of the device is an optical measurement system which monitors fluorescence during a nucleic acid assay. The white material in the center is a phase change material, which is used to store heat isothermally. You can also see some of the printed circuit boards (also designed by myself) towards the bottom of the picture.">Mechanical design<br><img src="assets/img/Crosssection_small.png"></a>

Rapid sampling is important so that I can tell the actuator to break at precisely the right time: high strain rates are essential for the largest temperature changes in the refrigerator, but overloading the sample is bad for material fatigue.">Sensors<br><img src="assets/img/Sensors_small.jpg"></a>

The large black object is a linear actuator with 3 inch stroke, 1.6 kip max dynamic load, and 0.7 inch/s speed. I've written the code for control of the actuator as well. What a fun system to build!
